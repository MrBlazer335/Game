## About Project
I created this game for the University to improve in Java. Spent a few months on that. The game is only available on Windows, maybe one day I will do it for Android.
Regret not using PPM. Also, there are a lot of places that I could improve with more knowledge and more time to spend.

## Tools Used for this

libGDX - Enjoyed working with it overall, and would like to use it again soon
Tiled - Pretty good tool, but I think I can find something better to reach my goals
GdxTexturePacker - Oh boy, as soon as I understood how it works, it made my life easier
SkinComposer - More like SceneComposer. Very useful, and also made my a lot easier

## About Game
Just a small platformer on one level. It sounds when the player collects apples which is the main goal and also reaches the end of the map.
If the player did not collect all the apples, he would not see the end screen even tho he reached the final goal. There are a lot of spikes, and the clouds are funny, just look for the apples
